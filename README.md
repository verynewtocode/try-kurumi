## Configurations:

* `volume`: 1.0, e.g 0.8 = 80%
* `chance_out_of`: 10000 → 1 in 10000 chance per second (lower values increase the frequency)

## Notes:

Make sure you're at **latest version** (Anki 2.1.50+) 

Please use it at your own risk

The add-on only works if you're focused on the main **Anki window**

Inspired by "1/10000 Chance for Withered Foxy Jumpscare Every Second" by **YMY** from TmodLoader.
